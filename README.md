   title: This is my paper about Big Data and Deep Learning
   abstract: Big Data is providing new opportunities for various industries in different sectors to enhance their performance by            performing analysis on the huge amounts of data available. However, this is not as easy as it is said. Storing, transforming and        performing analysis on such large amounts of data requires good storing and computational power. Many solutions have been proposed to    handle big data and use it to the benefit of the company like Map Reduce, Spark and so on. Deep learning is one of the popular          branches of machine learning which plays a key role when it comes to big data analytics
