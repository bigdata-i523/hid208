        Big Data is providing new opportunities for various industries in different  sectors
        to enhance their performance by performing analysis on the huge  amounts of
        data available. However, this is not as easy as it is said. Storing,  transforming
        and performing analysis on such large amounts of  data requires good storing
        and computational power. Many solutions have been proposed to     handle big
        data and use it to the benefit of the company like Map Reduce, Spark and so
        on.  Deep learning is one of the popular branches of machine learning which
        plays a key role  when it comes to big data analytics

    abstract: Analysis of data is not easy, especially when the data is unstructured or has many features. However, there are many algorithms for data pre-processing, feature selection, classification, regression, etc. These algorithms make it simpler to understand and analyze the data. One of the main types of algorithms for analyzing the data is clustering algorithms. They help to categorize the data into clusters. All the related data is collected under one cluster. Clustering facilitates easy analysis of data. However, when it comes to big data, ordinary clustering algorithms might not work because of the absence of formal categorization. Hence, there are modified clustering algorithms for big data and they are comparable to the already existing algorithms for ordinary data.

    title: Big Data Analytics on Influencers in Social Networks
    abstract: >
        Social Networking has become a part of people's lives with millions
of posts made every day. This huge volume of data paves the way to find interesting insights from data. Applying Big Data analytic methods on Twitter data helps in identifying the most influenced users.The Twitter data used for analysis is taken from Kaggle website. Performing feature selection tasks on this data has helped in identifying the important features that differentiate a user's influence over the other. By applying various Machine learning classification algorithms iteratively on these features obtained can be used to classify a user as more influential over the other.
