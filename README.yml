        Big Data is providing new opportunities for various industries in different  sectors
        to enhance their performance by performing analysis on the huge  amounts of
        data available. However, this is not as easy as it is said. Storing,  transforming
        and performing analysis on such large amounts of  data requires good storing
        and computational power. Many solutions have been proposed to     handle big
        data and use it to the benefit of the company like Map Reduce, Spark and so
        on.  Deep learning is one of the popular branches of machine learning which
        plays a key role  when it comes to big data analytics
