        Big Data is providing new opportunities for various industries
        in different sectors to enhance their performance by
        performing analysis on the huge amounts of data
        available. However, this is not as easy as it is
        said. Storing, transforming and performing analysis on such
        large amounts of data requires good storing and computational
        power. Many solutions have been proposed to handle big data
        and use it to the benefit of the company like Map Reduce,
        Spark and so on.  Deep learning is one of the popular branches
        of machine learning which plays a key role when it comes to
        big data analytics

        Analysis of data is not easy, especially when the data is
        unstructured or has many features. However, there are many
        algorithms for data pre-processing, feature selection,
        classification, regression, etc. These algorithms make it
        simpler to understand and analyze the data. One of the main
        types of algorithms for analyzing the data is clustering
        algorithms. They help to categorize the data into
        clusters. All the related data is collected under one
        cluster. Clustering facilitates easy analysis of
        data. However, when it comes to big data, ordinary clustering
        algorithms might not work because of the absence of formal
        categorization. Hence, there are modified clustering
        algorithms for big data and they are comparable to the already
        existing algorithms for ordinary data.

        Social Networking has become a part of people's lives with
        millions of posts made every day. This huge volume of data
        paves the way to find interesting insights from data. Applying
        Big Data analytic methods on Twitter data helps in identifying
        the most influenced users.The Twitter data used for analysis
        is taken from Kaggle website. Performing feature selection
        tasks on this data has helped in identifying the important
        features that differentiate a user's influence over the
        other. By applying various Machine learning classification
        algorithms iteratively on these features obtained can be used
        to classify a user as more influential over the other.
