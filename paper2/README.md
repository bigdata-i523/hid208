Analysis of data is not easy, especially when the data is unstructured or has many features. However, there are many algorithms for data pre-processing, feature selection, classification, regression, etc. These algorithms make it simpler to understand and analyze the data. One of the main types of algorithms for analyzing the data is clustering algorithms. They help to categorize the data into clusters. All the related data is collected under one cluster. Clustering facilitates easy analysis of data. However, when it comes to big data, ordinary clustering algorithms might not work because of the absence of formal categorization. Hence, there are modified clustering algorithms for big data and they are comparable to the already existing algorithms for ordinary data.
